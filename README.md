# Sign Language Recognition System

This project is a **Sign Language Recognition system** that uses **LSTM-based deep neural networks** for real-time recognition of hand gestures. It aims to bridge the communication gap for people with hearing and speech impairments by translating hand gestures into text or speech using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The Sign Language Recognition system is designed to capture hand gestures from video input and classify them into corresponding sign language symbols. The system uses **OpenCV** for video preprocessing and **TensorFlow** for building and training a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. This allows the system to recognize patterns in sequences of hand movements and accurately translate gestures into meaningful text or commands.

## Features
- **Real-time hand gesture detection** using OpenCV.
- **LSTM-based neural networks** for sequence-based gesture recognition.
- **Video preprocessing** to extract features from hand movements.
- **High accuracy** in recognizing a variety of sign language gestures.
- Easy integration for converting recognized gestures into text or speech.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For video capture and hand gesture detection.
  - TensorFlow: For building and training the deep learning model.
  - Keras: For high-level neural network API in TensorFlow.
  - NumPy, Pandas: For data manipulation.
- **Model**:
  - LSTM-based deep neural network for recognizing sequences in hand gestures.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition-system.git
   cd sign-language-recognition-system
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Capture video sequences of hand gestures using OpenCV or use a pre-labeled dataset of sign language gestures.
   - Preprocess the video data to extract key features (e.g., hand position, orientation).

4. **Train the LSTM model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Run the recognition system**:
   ```bash
   python sign_language_recognition.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Real-time recognition**: Point a webcam or camera at the signer making gestures, and the system will classify the gestures into their corresponding sign language characters.
- **Pre-recorded video recognition**: Input a pre-recorded video of sign language gestures for the system to process.

## Results
The LSTM model achieves high accuracy in recognizing common hand gestures in sign language. The system efficiently translates video sequences into text, making it a useful tool for real-time communication support.
