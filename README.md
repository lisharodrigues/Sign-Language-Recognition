# Sign-Language-Recognition
This project is a Sign Language Recognition system that uses LSTM-based deep neural networks for real-time recognition of hand gestures. It aims to bridge the communication gap for people with hearing and speech impairments by translating hand gestures into text or speech using advanced machine learning techniques.
